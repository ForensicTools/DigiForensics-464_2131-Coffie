DigiForensics-464_2131-Coffie
=============================

USB tool for memory imaging orignally intended for the Digispark.

WARNING THIS TOOL IS STILL IN DEVELOPEMENT AND IS NOT STABLE!

I'm currently going to be proceeding with the teensy until I can get the keyboard library adapted for my specific use.
This recently has been proving to be a roadblock. If you would Like to contribute to the project this will definitely be a ideal task.
You can contact me at CalebCoffie@gmail for more details.
